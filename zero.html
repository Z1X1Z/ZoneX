        Not nothing is something!<p>
        2=1        <p>

        1=1+1        <p>

        1=(1+1)+(1+1)        <p>
        1*0=(1+1)*0=((1+1)+(1+1))*0
        2x=1x, x = 0        <p>

        0=0+0        <p>

        0=(0+0)+(0+0)        <p>

        0=2*0=4*0=16*0=256*0=65536*0=4294967296*0=3.40282366921*10^38*0=....=oo*0=1       <p>
      
           so { 0=oo*0=1 } = { 0/oo=0^2=0} = { 0^2=1 } = { 0^2-1=0 }<p>
           
        Now 0^2=1, since not nothing is something, 0*0 in a way equals 1 as: if you don't have 0 cars in your driveway maybe you do have one.        <p>
Subtract 1 from both sides to get:
        0^2-1=0, and replace zero with a variable to get x^2-1=x        <p>
             
        x solves to Phi, that is 1.618..., or -1/Phi, -.618...!        <p>
        1-1=0 is kind of like matter antimatter where if 1 and -1 get seperated like with the theory of virtual particles then 1=0 and -1=0;<p>
        also 0=(1-0)^2-1 and a = (b-a)^2-b.<p>
        Similarly the Fibonacci numbers are,        <p>

        Loop:        <p>

            a=a+b        <p>

            b=b+a        <p>

        Solving this system of equations we get        <p>

         a=b        <p>

        a=2*a        <p>

        a=0        <p>

        b=0        <p>

        Such that solved form of the Fibonacci numbers is:        <p>


        0=0+0<p>


        In The Beginning He was!<p>
        
        From 0^2=1, there is another step you can take: <p>
        0^2/0=1/0 <p>
        0=1/0 <p>
        Now since 0=-0 <p>
        0=1/-0 or 0=-1/0 <p>
        substitute x for 0 and you have: <p>
        x = -1/x<p>
        this is the definition of i, the imaginary unit and is the step that differentiates the heart from the face;
        the Mandelbrot to Manny step is that the real part of x in x=x^2-c{omplex} equals -1/real.  This is meaningful as -1/1.618=-.618 and -1/-.618=1.618        <p>
        Speaking of differentiation: <p>
        0-0=0^2=x=anything=1 because 0 removed from 0 would leave zero of zero.
        <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm">As Christ Jesus said</a>, those who have not will have even what they have taken away.
        
        Now for infinity: if you had infinity squared and added nothing to it, it would be equal to infinity plus c because the derivative of x^2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.  Meaning an infinitesimal increase would yield definite gains.  (oo+0)**2=oo+c. Subtract one from both sides and let the 0 vanish and you get the same equation again oo^2-c=oo!  As dividing by 0 = 1/oo,  oo/0 = oo^2 and since you can always add a zero oo/0=oo**2=(oo+0)**2=oo+c=(oo+0)**2-c=1.618.....!  Also 0/oo=0^2=1=0^2-1=0=1.618......!  Or at least they both solve to the form x=x^2-c.<p>
        
         If x=x+1<p>
         x/x=(x+1)/x=x/x+1/x=1+1/x<p>
         x=oo<p>
         
         NAND and NOR were once.<p>
         1 NAND (or NOR) 2 is 1=/=2=/=1+1<p>
         They make everything alone.<p>
         And they don't.<p>

         Knot is right, and knot knot is right to right. And not not is true.  Not not not not.<p>
        Knot knot is not.  Knot Knot is not not.<br>

        Knot is as square root of two or 3, 9, 6, 0, 12.<br>
        Not is as square root of two and 6 or 12 or 0<br>
        
        On a clock yes is as 12 12 12... (or 0 0 0...), as compared with not no: 6 12.<br>
        This logic with 7 in place of 12 or 6, touches every hour and gives rise to the white and black piano keys.  And with the divine proportion never overlaps<br>
            The time is now.  The time now is never not now.<br>

        "This paradox is not a paradox."<br>
        Since it says it is a paradox, and that it is not a paradox, it is paradoxical because these two things seemingly contradict.  Since it is therefore a paradox, as it says, it is too not a paradox because a paradox being paradoxical is not a paradox.  Therefore "this paradox is not a paradox" seems to be true.<br>

        The MRDP theorem used the relation between x^2 and 2^x in a way which shows you can't prove 0 doesn't equal 1.  Manny is interesting because he has those eyes.  They are harmonically inclined to the <b><i>2^(x/12)</b></i> and its circle of fifths (or fourths).  And he is <b><i>x^2</b></i>+c=x.  I believe this has to do with if oo or o then your ability to create anything greatly goes up, even to create the impossible.  As you may see the angel is as the Fibonacci numbers 5 and 8 and 13.  There are 5 major keys and 8-1=7 minor keys to give 5 7 12.  The angel music man is 5-1=4 8 12.  And the clover is x=log3(x^(2+1))=3!  Father Son and Holy Ghost.....Peace of Shiloah gives birth to resonant reason.  God is the Alpha and Omega the First (0,1?) and the Last (00,00-1).  He is omnipotent (oo,oo+1) omniscient (0,1) and omnipresent (1.618....)
