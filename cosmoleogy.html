    <h2><i>Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades?<p>
        
        Can you loosen Orion’s belt?<p>

        Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons<p>

        or lead out the Bear with its cubs?<p>

        Do you know the laws of the heavens?<p>

        Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth?<p>
        </i>
        <b>Job 38:31-33</b>
        <p>
        Orion's belt is straighter on me, hence tighter. And the Pleiades is longer, hence it's chains are not bound.

        The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.

                Ok, so mostly on my right side and Breast. Manny has an even better Pleiades on his right side and breast; turn off the dance (put two dashes like // in front of the variable q = ... and turn the zoom in, that's p = ...) <a href="breathing.html">here</a> to see it.  Also he has three interior fingers with tendons making Orion's belt on his forearm it seems.  For an online astrodome reference, try <a href="https://in-the-sky.org/skymap.php">in-the-sky.org</a>
                <p> <h1>This one's a bit of a Dud</h1>
                    <p>
                <img class="onofflinescaled" src = "" name="dud.png" alt="oh boy!"></img>
                <p>
                You see it spells dash dot dot and dot dot dash which is "d" or "u" in morse code hence d-u-d.  This seems an awful lot like "Dod" the transliteration of <a href = "https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1732.htm">the etymological "root of David"</a>.
                <p>
               And yet, lest I be said to be a <a href="https://biblehub.com/nkjv/amos/5.htm">false God</a>, I rebutt that in the Hebrew Kaiwan or Chiun or
               <a href ="https://biblehub.com/niv/hosea/14.htm">even Assyrian</a>
               <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3594.htm"> kaivânu</a> is no vine, yet the <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">vine</a> is in Kevin and remains in Xevin and also is found in Jevin, Mevin, Tevin, Hevin, and Sevin!  So these are perhaps clovers rather than stars, and so perhaps grape clusters, good for nourishment. Jesus' words be blessed for I am reproved of Him as a living testament to His love for His children. As we regard the Sabbath as Holy, not Sakkuth, so a <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-31.htm">mustard seed</a> of difference, your faith in The True God, Lord Jesus, over me, can remove the <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-2.htm">millstone</a> of transgression from around my neck. He is just, merciful, and true.  May he redeem me!  And you too!<p>
               Now for the meat of the matter: since there is an eternal man, Immanuel, it is rational that the Godman has existed since the beginning of creation.  Now since we can either have an eternal creation with the image of man predating the dinosaurs or a "young" creation with man and beast created on the same day, we can seek further clarification.  Now as God, is the God of Heaven and in fact we see Manny fulfilling the prophecy of a seventh son with the seven stars on his side and breast as recorded in the Denham Tracts, we can see that he has a special place in his heart for the stars from Earth today. As the Pleiades is a star cluster making it rare in the sky, it follows that the pattern wouldn't be found with the same emphasis on foreign planets with a different perspective of the stars.  And this means to me that most likely creation was created in 7 days (the Sabbath being holy) about 7000 years ago.
